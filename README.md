socket programming for DNS


The main function of DNS is to translate domain names into IP Addresses, which computers can understand. It also provides a list of mail servers which accept Emails for each domain name.

This is a sample protocol which exhibits the same functionality but running locally having cache in its own as text file and does the iterative search for the IP resolution
